## AnimalClassificationKeras
This repository contains the implementation of an animal classification task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code is written in Python and uses TensorFlow and OpenCV for image manipulation and model building.

# Data set 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10

# Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

2 Convolutional layers
Batch normalization
MaxPooling
Dropout layers
1 Fully connected Dense layer
I use a softmax activation in the output layer to categorize the input image into one of the five classes.
